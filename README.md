**Problem Statements**
The Human Resource and Development (HRD) in a Pharmaceutical Company is getting complaints recently about the high attrition number. Employee attrition poses challenges for a company [4]:
Expense: Significant financial resources are required for recruiting, training, and integrating new employees, making high employee attrition costly.
Loss of expertise: Departure of experienced and skilled employees results in a depletion of knowledge, proficiency, and talent, which can impede the organization's overall productivity and performance.
Reduced morale: Excessive attrition rates create anxiety and uncertainty among remaining staff, leading to diminished morale and motivation.
Disruption of operations: Employee turnover disrupts workflows and processes, leading to delays and increased workload for remaining employees.
Reputation: A company's reputation in the job market is adversely affected by high employee attrition, making it more challenging to attract and retain top talent in the future.

**Goals**
To make a meaningful dashboard to address the problem, the following goals to be achieved are:
Produce a descriptive dashboard for HR personnels containing information to identify the characteristics of employees who resigned.  .
The dashboard consists of comparison between several correlating attrition features and the baseline of the industry. 
Deliver insight to relevant users on which features need to be improved.

The final product will be a dashboard containing information on the Employment Satisfaction factors and several correlated variables to be used for a diagnostic analysis, including making a recommendation on which factors need to be improved within the Department or the JobRole.  

**Metrics**
From the goals requested by the HRD Department, we will analyze the 5 points that contribute to the Employee Satisfaction Index (ESI), namely Environment Satisfaction, JobInvolvement, JobSatisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction, and Work LifeBalance. 
The metrics used are:
Employee attrition rate: The percentage of employees who leave the company voluntarily or involuntarily in a given period. 
Employee satisfaction index: Measured through employee surveys.

**Scenario**
To solve this problem, the HRD Department together with the IT Department of the Data unit are required to produce a dashboard to be used for the people analysis process to identify the factors behind the high attrition rate and find factors that can improve employee retention.
